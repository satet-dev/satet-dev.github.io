<h2>SPC tools</h2>
<p>Help us to identify the source of process problems, define a process’s capability to meet a customer
requirement, and assist with other insights
Control charts typically display the limits that statistical variability can explain as normal. If your process is
performing within these limits, it is said to be in control; if not, it is out of control.</p>

<h2>Nelson Rules</h2>
<p>How do you judge when a process is out of control? By plotting a control chart of the output of a process, it is
possible to spot special or unnatural causes of variability and indications that the process is drifting. Drifting is
defined by the mean or range of the variation changing as the process is running. The most common indication of
change is a point falling outside of the control limits, but other tests for process instability are also valuable.
Zones In Control Charts
Many of the standard rules examine points based on zones. The area between each control limit and the centerline is divided
into thirds. The third closest to the centerline is referred to as Zone A, the next third is Zone B, and the third closest to the
control limits is Zone C. Note that there are two of each of the Zones, one upper and one lower.
Zone A is also referred to as the “3-sigma zone”, Zone B is the “2-sigma zone”, and Zone C is the “1-sigma zone”. These sigma
zone terms are appropriate only when 3-sigma is used for the control limits.
Sigma is the Greek letter for s and is used in this context to denote the spread of data.
Standard control limits are located 3 sigma away from the average or centerline of the chart. The centerline is also called
the control line. These are called 3 sigma limits or 3 sigma zones. The distance from the centerline to the control limits can be
divided into 3 equal parts of one sigma each.
Statistical theory tell us that in normal data dispersion, we can expect the following percentages of data to be included within
the sigma:</p>
<p>
 1 sigma – 68.3%
 2 sigma – 95.5%
 3 sigma – 99.7%
</p>
We can expect 99.7% of the process outcomes to be within the 3-sigma control limits.
