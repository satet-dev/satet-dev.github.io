Cookie Policy of SATET.US
This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Website to achieve the purposes described
below. Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use
resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with this Website.
For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as &quot;Trackers&quot; within this document – unless there is a reason to
differentiate.
For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about
Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document,
the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.
Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User&#39;s consent. Whenever consent is
given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.
This Website uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that
enable services provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this
document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.
The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by
the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.
In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise
and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information – such as the
presence of other Trackers - in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the
Owner.
Activities strictly necessary for the operation of this Website and delivery of the Service
This Website uses so-called “technical” Cookies and other similar Trackers to carry out activities that are strictly
necessary for the operation or delivery of the Service.
Other activities involving the use of Trackers
Basic interactions &amp; functionalities
This Website uses Trackers to enable basic interactions and functionalities, allowing Users to access selected
features of the Service and facilitating the User&#39;s communication with the Owner.
 Tag Management
Experience enhancement
This Website uses Trackers to provide a personalized user experience by improving the quality of preference
management options, and by enabling interaction with external networks and platforms.
 Interaction with external social networks and platforms
Measurement
This Website uses Trackers to measure traffic and analyze User behavior with the goal of improving the Service.
 Analytics
Targeting &amp; Advertising
This Website uses Trackers to deliver personalized marketing content based on User behavior and to operate,
serve and track ads.
 Advertising
 Remarketing and behavioral targeting

User database management
How to manage preferences and provide or withdraw consent
There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and to provide and withdraw consent, where
relevant:
Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by
preventing the use or storage of Trackers.
Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users can provide or withdraw such consent by
setting their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant
consent-preferences widget, if available.
It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including those used
to remember the User’s initial consent.
Other Trackers in the browser’s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.
With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their preferences and withdraw their consent via the
related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party&#39;s privacy policy, or by
contacting the third party.
Locating Tracker Settings
Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the
following addresses:
 Google Chrome
 Mozilla Firefox
 Apple Safari
 Microsoft Internet Explorer
 Microsoft Edge
 Brave
 Opera
Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device
settings, such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open
the device settings, view and look for the relevant setting).
Owner and Data Controller

Owner contact email: Contact@satet.us
Since the use of third-party Trackers through this Website cannot be fully controlled by the Owner, any specific
references to third-party Trackers are to be considered indicative. In order to obtain complete information, Users are
kindly requested to consult the privacy policies of the respective third-party services listed in this document.
Given the objective complexity surrounding tracking technologies, Users are encouraged to contact the Owner
should they wish to receive any further information on the use of such technologies by this Website.
